# Automated Testing and Quality Assurance for features leveraging LLMs and implementing Agentic Software Systems

- Based off "React + TypeScript + Vite" - Storybook Template
- Adapted to be used with bun, tailwindcss, bun:test

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Where are the ESLint and Prettier configurations?

Nowhere actually. I'd like to use this opportunity to familiarize myself, and possibly others further with [biomejs](https://biomejs.dev/) as well. Stating "Format, lint, and more in a fraction of a second." - a single tool for these tasks. With a shareable configuration for the whole team.
